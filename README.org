* The Jim Text Editor

** installation

   Jim is still an unfinished piece of software.

   There are 2 ways to run it:

   1. using run.sh

      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      $ ./run.sh
      #+END_SRC

   2. building with asdf

      #+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
      (asdf:make :jim)
      #+END_SRC

      this will produce an executable ~jim~ in the current directory

** usage

   jim's keybindings are based on vim's with the following exceptions:
   - ~:w~ and ~:e~ take their arguments quoted: ~:e "test.lisp"~
   - ~:e~ will open a file in a new buffer
